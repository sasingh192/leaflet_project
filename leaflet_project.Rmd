```{r, comment=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(leaflet)
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "YlOrRd",
  domain = quakes$mag
)
# require(Hmisc)
# quakes$Mag <- cut(quakes$mag, 5)
quakes %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addCircleMarkers(color = ~pal(mag)) %>% 
        addLegend("bottomright", pal=pal, val= ~quakes$mag, title="Earthquake Magnitude", opacity = 1)
